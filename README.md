# Pyxis-Issues
This is the first pipeline to calibrate, image and extarct sources within the field of view of the KAT-7. Three files are attached: one is the python script, and the conf file contains the neccessary parameters to imaging, creating directories, and others. The third one is a profile file that contains the parameters obtained from Meqtrees to do the calibaration. In the head of this file, a name is given to call in the script.
